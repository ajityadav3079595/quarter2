<h1>Southeast Asia and United States Zinc Scrap Market Report &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The Southeast Asia and United States <strong>zinc scrap market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 650 million in 2024 to USD 980 million by 2032</strong> for Southeast Asia, growing at a robust <strong>CAGR of 6.1% during 2025–2032</strong>, while the United States market is anticipated to rise from <strong>USD 1.8 billion to USD 2.4 billion by 2030</strong> at a <strong>CAGR of 4.3%</strong>, according to a comprehensive new market study. This growth is underpinned by surging demand for <strong>sustainable recycling practices, infrastructure development, and galvanized steel applications</strong> in construction and automotive sectors across both regions.</p><p>Zinc scrap—recycled materials recovered from industrial waste, galvanized steel, brass alloys, and post-consumer products—undergoes purification to serve key applications like galvanizing for corrosion protection, alloy production including brass and bronze, and chemical manufacturing. Categorized into new scrap from pre-consumer sources and old scrap from post-consumer uses, its value hinges on purity levels, making it a vital component in the push toward circular economy models that reduce reliance on primary mining.</p><p><strong>1. Surging Demand for Galvanized Steel in Construction and Automotive Sectors:</strong><br>
As infrastructure projects accelerate in Southeast Asia's emerging economies and the U.S. invests in renewal initiatives, galvanized steel consumption has climbed steadily. This material, essential for corrosion resistance, accounts for a substantial portion of zinc use, driving recyclers to process more scrap efficiently. Because zinc scrap provides cost savings of 15-20% over virgin metal without compromising quality, industries are increasingly turning to recycled sources to meet expanding needs in building and vehicle production.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The global shift toward sustainability is boosting recycling rates, with zinc leading non-ferrous metals at over 80% recovery in mature markets. In the U.S., recycled zinc supplies around 65% of the metal needs, helping companies cut carbon emissions from energy-intensive primary production. Furthermore, Southeast Asian governments are rolling out policies to formalize recycling, creating a supportive environment that encourages investment in scrap handling and processing infrastructure.</p><p><strong>3. Regional Industrialization and Regulatory Support:</strong><br>
While the U.S. benefits from established environmental standards that promote recycling, Southeast Asia's rapid industrialization in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia is fueling demand for affordable zinc inputs. These factors combined are fostering localized supply chains, where scrap collection networks are expanding to support galvanizing operations, ultimately stabilizing supply amid global trade fluctuations.</p><p>Despite its promising trajectory, the market encounters notable obstacles:</p><p><strong>Fluctuating Zinc Prices and Volatile Supply Chains:</strong> Global zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange, averaging USD 2,800–3,200 per metric ton in 2023, have swung by over 30% year-over-year, complicating profitability for processors. This instability, driven by energy costs, geopolitics, and trade shifts, often forces adjustments in scrap pricing, disrupting long-term contracts and inventory strategies.</p><p><strong>Quality Inconsistencies and Logistical Hurdles:</strong> The varied composition of zinc scrap, from contaminated alloys to mixed waste, demands extra sorting and refining, elevating operational costs. In Southeast Asia, decentralized collection points exacerbate transportation expenses, particularly in rural areas where infrastructure lags, hindering efficient distribution to end-users.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Compliance and Informal Sector Pressures:</strong> Stricter emissions and safety rules in the U.S. and emerging Southeast Asian frameworks raise compliance expenses, requiring substantial investments in technology. Meanwhile, competition from informal recyclers, which handle a large share of collection but often ignore standards, creates market distortions and quality risks for formal players.</p><p><strong>1. Emerging Technologies in Zinc Scrap Processing:</strong><br>
Innovations like hydrometallurgical methods and automated sorting are opening doors to higher recovery from complex wastes, potentially boosting rates by 15-25%. These advancements not only enhance efficiency but also position companies to meet stricter purity demands in galvanizing and alloys, creating fresh revenue streams in a market hungry for reliable, high-grade recycled materials.</p><p><strong>2. Expansion of Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling:</strong><br>
With electric vehicle adoption surging, zinc from batteriesâstill used in about 15% of automotive applicationsâpresents a burgeoning source. Developing dedicated recycling facilities could add 8-12% to scrap volumes in the automotive space over the next decade. Partnerships between processors and manufacturers are emerging, fostering closed-loop systems that align with sustainability mandates and secure zinc supplies.</p><p><strong>3. Policy-Driven Infrastructure Investments:</strong><br>
Government incentives for green manufacturing in both regions are spurring expansions in recycling capacity. In Southeast Asia, formalization efforts are integrating informal sectors, while U.S. infrastructure bills promise increased scrap generation from projects, allowing processors to scale operations and capture value in growing end-markets like construction and renewables.</p><p><strong>Sustainable Recycling Practices and Circular Models:</strong><br>
	Emphasis on eco-friendly processes is reshaping the landscape, with galvanizing consuming over 60% of zinc in Southeast Asia and U.S. regulations pushing circularity. This trend encourages traceability and reduced emissions, helping firms differentiate in a competitive field while addressing global resource constraints.</p><p><strong>Technological Advancements in Sorting and Processing:</strong><br>
	Sensor-based and AI-driven systems are improving recovery by up to 15%, making recycled zinc more viable against primary sources. As these tools proliferate, especially in vertically integrated U.S. operations and Southeast Asia's processing hubs, they promise lower costs and higher purity, attracting investment from international traders.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Growth and Regional Dynamics:</strong><br>
	Construction booms, with Southeast Asia's sector expanding at 6% annually, alongside U.S. renewal programs, are generating more scrap while heightening demand. Distinct patternsâsmall-scale collectors in Asia versus integrated facilities in the U.S.âare evolving, with imports in Vietnam and Thailand underscoring the need for balanced trade to mitigate primary production cost pressures.</p><p>The market is <strong>fragmented yet consolidating</strong>, with key players such as <strong>Sims Metal Management, OmniSource Corporation, European Metal Recycling</strong>, and <strong>HS Metal Recycling</strong> leading through integrated operations and technological edges.
