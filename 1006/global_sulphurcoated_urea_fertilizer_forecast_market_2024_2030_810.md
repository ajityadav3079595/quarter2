<h1>Sulphur-Coated Urea Fertilizer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>Sulphur-Coated Urea Fertilizer market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.3 billion in 2023 to USD 2.1 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 7.6% during 2024-2030</strong>, according to new industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects increasing adoption of advanced slow-release fertilizers to meet rising agricultural productivity demands alongside tightening environmental regulations.</p><p>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU)âa controlled-release nitrogen fertilizerâhas gained prominence for its <strong>dual nutrient delivery (nitrogen + sulphur) and 40-50% reduction in nitrogen leaching losses</strong> compared to conventional urea. These characteristics make it particularly valuable for <strong>high-value crops, precision agriculture, and regions with strict environmental policies</strong> on nutrient runoff.</p><p><strong>1. Intensifying Global Food Security Pressures:</strong><br>
With global population projected to reach <strong>9.7 billion by 2050</strong>, SCU adoption is accelerating as farmers seek yield-boosting solutions. Field trials demonstrate <strong>15-20% higher crop yields</strong> with SCU versus conventional fertilizers, particularly in wheat, corn, and rice cultivation.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Stringent policies like the EU's Nitrates Directive and U.S. state-level nutrient management laws are driving SCU adoption. The technology reduces nitrate pollution by <strong>30-40%</strong> while maintaining crop productivity, making it compliant with sustainability mandates.</p><p><strong>3. Expansion in High-Value Specialty Agriculture:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 280 billion horticulture sector</strong> is increasingly adopting SCU for crops like berries, nuts, and vineyards where precise nutrient delivery impacts profitability. Growers report <strong>25% lower fertilization costs</strong> through reduced application frequency.</p><p>Despite strong growth prospects, several factors moderate market expansion:</p><p><strong>1. Climate-Smart Agriculture Initiatives:</strong><br>
Global carbon farming programs incentivizing emission reductions present new channels for SCU adoption. The technology qualifies for <strong>carbon credit programs</strong> by reducing nitrous oxide emissions by up to <strong>35%</strong> per hectare.</p><p><strong>2. Advanced Coating Technologies:</strong><br>
Next-generation polymer-sulphur hybrid coatings now extend nutrient release profiles to <strong>8-12 months</strong> while improving mechanical durability during applicationâaddressing historical limitations of early SCU products.</p><p><strong>3. Digital Integration with Precision Farming:</strong><br>
Combining SCU with soil sensors and variable-rate technology creates <strong>20-30% higher nutrient use efficiency</strong>. Major agtech providers are developing integrated SCU-digital solutions for large-scale farming operations.</p><p>The market features a mix of global chemical giants and specialized fertilizer companies, with <strong>Yara International, Nutrien, and ICL</strong> leading in technological innovation and distribution reach. Regional players like <strong>Coromandel International</strong> are gaining traction through localized product development and farmer education programs.</p><p>Recent competitive developments include:</p><p>This press release is based on the comprehensive market study "Global Sulphur-Coated Urea Fertilizer Market Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030."
