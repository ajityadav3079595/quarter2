Regenerative Agriculture Partnerships:</strong><br>
Forward-thinking brands are collaborating with cotton farmers to implement <strong>carbon-negative farming practices</strong>. These initiatives not only improve soil health but also generate premium-priced "climate positive" textile lines that appeal to environmentally conscious buyers.</p><p><strong>Blended Performance Fabrics:</strong><br>
    Hybrid materials combining organic cotton with Tencel or recycled polyester are gaining traction, offering <strong>enhanced durability and moisture-wicking properties</strong> while maintaining sustainability credentials.</p><p><strong>Regional Sourcing Networks:</strong><br>
    Major European brands are establishing <strong>localized organic cotton supply chains</strong> in Turkey and Eastern Europe to reduce transport emissions and ensure EU regulatory compliance from raw material stage.</p><p><strong>Circular Business Models:</strong><br>
