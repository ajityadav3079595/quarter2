<h1>Global Gypsum Fibreboard Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>gypsum fibreboard market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 18.2 billion in 2024 to USD 28.7 billion by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong>CAGR of 7.9%</strong> during the forecast period, according to comprehensive industry analysis. This growth is primarily driven by increasing construction activities worldwide and rising demand for <strong>fire-resistant and moisture-resistant building materials</strong> in both residential and commercial sectors.</p><p>Gypsum fibreboard, known for its <strong>superior strength, durability and environmental benefits</strong> compared to traditional drywall, has become the material of choice for modern construction projects. Its <strong>100% recyclability and low VOC emissions</strong> align perfectly with the global push towards sustainable building practices.</p><p><strong>1. Construction Boom and Urbanization:</strong><br>
The global construction industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, with <strong>Asia-Pacific leading at a 8.4% annual growth rate</strong>. Countries like China and India are investing heavily in infrastructure, with China alone accounting for <strong>35% of global gypsum fibreboard consumption</strong> in 2023. The material's <strong>40% faster installation time</strong> compared to conventional drywall makes it particularly attractive for large-scale projects.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

With <strong>78% of new commercial buildings</strong> now requiring Class A fire-rated materials in developed markets, gypsum fibreboard's inherent fire resistance without additional treatments gives it a significant advantage. The European Union's latest construction directives have increased demand by <strong>22% year-over-year</strong> for fire-resistant variants.</p><p><strong>3. Green Building Certifications:</strong><br>
The <strong>LEED-certified building sector</strong>, growing at 11% annually, consistently specifies gypsum fibreboard due to its <strong>95% recycled content</strong> and low embodied carbon. Major corporations adopting net-zero building standards are driving further market expansion in North America and Europe.</p><p>While the outlook remains positive, several factors are tempering growth:</p><p><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:</strong> Gypsum prices fluctuated <strong>15-20% quarterly</strong> in 2023 due to supply chain disruptions, forcing manufacturers to implement multiple price adjustments.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Divergence:</strong> Varying regional standards for construction materials add <strong>7-9 months</strong> to product approval timelines, particularly between EU and Asian markets.</p><p><strong>Competition from Alternatives:</strong> New fiber cement products captured <strong>12% market share</strong> in exterior applications last year, though gypsum maintains dominance in interior uses.</p><p><strong>1. Prefabricated Construction Revolution:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 154 billion modular construction sector</strong> increasingly uses gypsum fibreboard for its dimensional stability and ease of prefabrication. Manufacturers are developing <strong>specialized panel systems</strong> that reduce on-site labor by up to 60%.</p><p><strong>2. Acoustic Performance Innovations:</strong><br>
New manufacturing techniques have improved sound insulation by <strong>35% compared to standard boards</strong>, opening opportunities in commercial offices, educational facilities and healthcare buildings where noise control is critical.</p><p><strong>3. Emerging Market Penetration:</strong><br>
Manufacturers are establishing local production in high-growth regions, with <strong>9 new plants</strong> announced in Southeast Asia and Africa in 2023 alone. Localization reduces logistics costs by <strong>18-22%</strong> and improves market responsiveness.</p><p><strong>Thinner, Stronger Formulations:</strong> Development of <strong>8-10mm boards</strong> matching the performance of traditional 12-15mm products allows for material savings and easier handling.</p><p><strong>Integrated Building Solutions:</strong> Manufacturers now offer complete wall systems combining structural, insulation and finishing properties in single panel solutions.</p><p><strong>Digital Integration:</strong> Leading brands are incorporating QR codes and RFID tags for <strong>blockchain-enabled material tracing</strong> throughout the construction lifecycle.</p><p>The market remains <strong>moderately concentrated</strong>, with global players like <strong>Saint-Gobain, Knauf and USG</strong> controlling approximately <strong>45% of market share</strong>. These leaders compete through:</p><p>Regional specialists such as <strong>BNBM and Yoshino</strong> are gaining traction through:</p><p><strong>By Product Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By End-Use:</strong></p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the <em>Global Gypsum Fibreboard Market Research Report 2024 (Status and Outlook)</em>, providing in-depth analysis of market size, trends, competitive landscape, and growth opportunities through 2030.
