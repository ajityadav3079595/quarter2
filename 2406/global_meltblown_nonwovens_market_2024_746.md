<h1>Global Melt-Blown Nonwovens Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global Melt-Blown Nonwovens market is projected to grow from USD 3.78 billion in 2024 to USD 5.67 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 7.0%</strong> during the forecast period, according to the latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects sustained demand across medical, filtration, and hygiene sectors despite post-pandemic normalization.</p><p>Melt-blown nonwovensâa microfiber material manufactured through high-velocity air streamsâhave become indispensable in modern industries. Their <strong>superior filtration efficiency (99%+ for PM2.5 particles)</strong> and customizable pore structures make them particularly valuable for <strong>medical PPE, advanced air filtration systems, and high-performance absorbent cores</strong> in hygiene products.</p><p><strong>1. Healthcare Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
Global healthcare expenditure reaching <strong>USD 10 trillion by 2025</strong> continues to drive demand for medical-grade nonwovens. Surgical drapes, N95 masks, and wound dressings accounted for <strong>38% of total consumption</strong> in 2023. The material's inherent bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) exceeding 95% makes it clinically essential.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
