<h1>Squalane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>squalane market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.92 billion in 2025 to USD 3.28 billion by 2032</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 7.8%</strong> during the forecast period, according to new industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects accelerating demand across cosmetics, personal care, and pharmaceutical sectors, driven by squalane's unique properties as a <strong>biocompatible, non-greasy emollient</strong> with exceptional oxidative stability.</p><p><strong>1. Plant-Based Revolution in Cosmetics:</strong><br>
The clean beauty movement has propelled plant-derived squalane to the forefront, with <strong>42% of new skincare launches</strong> now featuring sustainable alternatives to animal-derived ingredients. Sugarcane and olive-based squalane dominate this shift, growing at <strong>11.2% annually</strong> as brands like Biossance and The Ordinary reformulate with 100% plant origins.</p><p><strong>2. Pharmaceutical Applications Expansion:</strong><br>
The US FDA's 2023 approval of squalane as an excipient in topical medications has opened a <strong>USD 780 million niche</strong> in dermatological treatments.
