Next-Generation Flavor Delivery Systems:</strong><br>
Advanced microencapsulation technologies allow <strong>30% more efficient flavor release</strong> in HNB products, while novel carrier systems improve stability in e-liquids. These innovations help overcome technical limitations in alternative tobacco formats.</p><p><strong>2. Botanical and Functional Flavors:</strong><br>
The integration of adaptogenic herbs and functional botanicals like ginseng and ginger addresses growing consumer demand for products with perceived wellness benefitsânow featured in <strong>18% of new tobacco product launches</strong> in Asian markets.</p><p><strong>3.
