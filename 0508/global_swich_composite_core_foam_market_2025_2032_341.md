<h1>Sandwich Composite Core Foam Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>sandwich composite core foam market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 814 million in 2023 to USD 1.15 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 5% during 2025-2032</strong>, according to industry analysis. This expansion is primarily driven by escalating demand for lightweight, high-strength materials across aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy sectors.</p><p>Sandwich composite core foams â the lightweight structural materials sandwiched between rigid outer layers â have become indispensable in modern engineering. These materials deliver <strong>exceptional strength-to-weight ratios, thermal insulation, and energy absorption</strong>, making them pivotal for applications ranging from aircraft interiors to wind turbine blades.</p><p><strong>1. Aerospace Industry's Weight Reduction Imperative:</strong><br>
With commercial aircraft manufacturers targeting <strong>15-20% weight reduction</strong> in next-generation models, composite core foams are seeing accelerated adoption. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for instance, uses sandwich composites for <strong>over 50% of its airframe</strong>, setting new benchmarks for fuel efficiency.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
