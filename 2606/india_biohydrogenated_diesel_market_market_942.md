<h1>India Bio-Hydrogenated Diesel (BHD) Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The <strong>India Bio-Hydrogenated Diesel (BHD) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 78 million in 2024 to USD 156 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>12.3%</strong> during the forecast period. This robust growth trajectory is fueled by accelerating demand for sustainable fuel alternatives and governmental policies promoting biofuel adoption across transportation and industrial sectors.</p><p>Bio-hydrogenated dieselâa premium drop-in fuel derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or waste greases through hydroprocessingâhas emerged as a critical solution for India's energy transition. With <strong>50-90% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions</strong> compared to conventional diesel, BHD is gaining traction among fleet operators and energy-intensive industries seeking to reduce carbon footprints while maintaining engine performance.</p><p><strong>1. Stringent Emission Regulations &amp; Clean Fuel Mandates:</strong><br>
India's commitment to cutting transportation emissions by 30% under its NDC targets has accelerated biofuel policies. The <strong>National Policy on Biofuels 2018</strong> mandates 5% biodiesel blending (B5) nationwide, with state-level initiatives like Maharashtra's 10% blending target pushing adoption. This regulatory push has increased BHD demand by <strong>22% annually</strong> since 2021.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

With <strong>85% of crude oil demand being imported</strong>, India's INR 12,000 crore investment in second-generation bio-refineries aims to leverage domestic feedstock, including jatropha, pongamia, and used cooking oil. Recent capacity expansions by players like IOCL and BPCL have increased domestic BHD production by <strong>40% since 2022</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. Corporate Sustainability Commitments:</strong><br>
Major fleet operatorsâincluding Indian Railways and leading logistics firmsâare transitioning to BHD blends to meet ESG targets. The commercial vehicle segment accounted for <strong>68% of 2023 demand</strong>, driven by B20 adoption in mining and long-haul transport.</p><p>The sector faces structural hurdles despite its potential:</p><p><strong>1. Advanced Feedstock Innovation:</strong><br>
Research into algae-based oils and genetically modified feedstocks could boost yields by 300%. The DBT's <strong>â¹250 crore bioenergy program</strong> supports pilot projects using agricultural residues.</p><p><strong>2. Hydrogen-Biofuel Synergies:</strong><br>
Green hydrogen integration in BHD productionâdemonstrated by GAIL's upcoming 10 TPD plantâcan reduce process emissions by 60%, qualifying for carbon credits under the CORSIA aviation fuel standard.</p><p><strong>3. Export Potential:</strong><br>
With EU's RED III mandating 14% renewable energy in transport by 2030, Indian BHD producers are positioning for exports, leveraging cost advantages of <strong>30-40% over European producers</strong>.</p><p>The market is led by integrated energy majors including:</p><p>Emerging players focus on decentralized production models, with startups like Biotor Industries leveraging modular reactors to serve regional markets.</p><p>This analysis draws from comprehensive market intelligence on India's Bio-Hydrogenated Diesel sector (2024-2030), evaluating production economics, policy impacts, competitive strategies, and emerging technological disruptions shaping the renewable fuel landscape.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
