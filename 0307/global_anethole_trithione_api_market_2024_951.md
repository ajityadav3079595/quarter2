<h1>Global Anethole Trithione API Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>Anethole Trithione API market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$35 million in 2024 to US$48 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.4%</strong> during the forecast period, according to recent market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects the increasing therapeutic applications of Anethole Trithione in hepatobiliary disorders and xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome), coupled with expanding pharmaceutical manufacturing activities across emerging markets.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Prevalence of Hepatobiliary Disorders:</strong><br>
With global cases of cholecystitis and hepatitis growing at <strong>4.2% annually</strong>, Anethole Trithione's bile-stimulating properties make it a critical component in digestive health formulations. The compound's ability to increase salivary secretion by <strong>55-60%</strong> in clinical trials has cemented its position in dry mouth therapies.</p><p><strong>2. Pharmaceutical Industry Expansion in Asia-Pacific:</strong><br>
China's pharmaceutical API market, growing at <strong>7.8% CAGR</strong>, is driving regional production. Domestic manufacturers now account for <strong>42% of global Anethole Trithione API supply</strong>, with companies like Shanghai Cathay Chemical and Hubei Hongxin Ruiyu significantly expanding capacity in 2023.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
