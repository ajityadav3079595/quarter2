<h1>Biomass Fuel (PKS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>biomass fuel (PKS) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>$1.48 billion in 2024 to $2.82 billion by 2031</strong>, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>9.8%</strong>, according to new industry analysis. This remarkable growth trajectory stems from the urgent global transition toward renewable energy solutions, with palm kernel shells emerging as a key biomass feedstock due to their carbon-neutral properties and increasing availability as a palm oil industry byproduct.</p><p>Palm kernel shells (PKS) have gained recognition as a sustainable biomass fuel with several compelling advantages:</p><p><strong>1. Global Renewable Energy Mandates:</strong><br>
Over <strong>140 countries</strong> now have renewable energy targets, with biomass playing a crucial role in decarbonizing industrial heat and power generation. Japan's feed-in-tariff program for biomass power generation has been particularly influential, creating substantial demand for PKS imports.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Energy-intensive industries like cement and pulp/paper are actively substituting coal with biomass fuels to meet emission reduction targets. PKS offers several operational advantages including easier handling and storage compared to other biomass fuels.</p><p><strong>3. Southeast Asian Production Growth:</strong><br>
Indonesia and Malaysia - which account for <strong>85% of global palm oil production</strong> - are investing in PKS collection and processing infrastructure, improving both quantity and quality of available supply.</p><p>The industry currently faces several operational and regulatory hurdles:</p><p><strong>1. Torrefaction Technology:</strong><br>
      Advanced thermal treatment processes can enhance PKS energy density by up to <strong>30%</strong>, improving economic viability for long-distance transport.</p><p><strong>2. Co-firing Applications:</strong><br>
      Power plants are increasingly blending PKS with other fuels, with successful tests demonstrating <strong>20-30%</strong> substitution rates without boiler modifications.</p><p><strong>3. Carbon Credit Linkages:</strong><br>
      The developing voluntary carbon market creates potential additional revenue streams for PKS-based energy projects through emission offset monetization.</p><p>The market features a mix of:</p><p>Leading participants include:</p><p>These companies are differentiating through:</p><p>The PKS market is poised for continued expansion, driven by:</p><p>However, the industry must address several critical issues to maintain growth momentum:</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
