<h1>Thimerosal Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global thimerosal market, while facing increasing regulatory scrutiny, continues to find applications in specific pharmaceutical and industrial sectors where its antimicrobial properties remain valuable. As a mercury-based compound (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>9</sub>HgNaO<sub>2</sub>S), thimerosal has been historically used as a preservative in multi-dose vaccines and other biological products.</p><p>Global thimerosal market size was valued at <strong>USD 26.5 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 42.9 million by 2032</strong>, growing at a CAGR of <strong>5.8% during 2025-2032</strong>. This growth occurs despite increasing restrictions in developed markets, as demand persists in developing regions where multi-dose vaccine formulations remain essential for public health programs.</p><p>The North American market has seen the most significant decline in thimerosal use, particularly in human vaccines. However, it maintains niche applications in certain industrial and research contexts. The U.S. FDA maintains specific guidelines for its limited use, focusing on alternatives where possible.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
