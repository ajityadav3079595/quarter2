<h1>Gas Purification Membranes Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>gas purification membranes market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.23 billion in 2024 to USD 2.18 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 8.4%</strong> during the forecast period. This surge reflects escalating industrial demand for <strong>clean energy solutions and emission control technologies</strong> across key sectors including oil &amp; gas, chemicals, and power generation.</p><p>Gas purification membranesâthin, selective barriers that separate gas mixtures through permeationâare revolutionizing industrial gas processing with their <strong>energy efficiency, compact footprint, and operational flexibility</strong>. Their ability to selectively filter contaminants like COâ, HâS, and moisture makes them indispensable for <strong>carbon capture, hydrogen production, and biogas upgrading</strong> applications worldwide.</p><p><strong>1. Global Decarbonization Imperatives:</strong><br>
With 73 countries now committed to net-zero targets, carbon capture technologies are experiencing unprecedented demand. Membrane systems account for <strong>28% of global COâ separation capacity</strong> due to their 40-60% lower energy consumption compared to amine-based absorption.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The USD 160 billion hydrogen market increasingly relies on membrane purification, with polymer membranes now achieving <strong>99.99% hydrogen purity</strong> for fuel cell applications. Over 120 hydrogen projects under development globally will require membrane-based purification solutions.</p><p><strong>3. Stringent Environmental Regulations:</strong><br>
New EPA guidelines mandating 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 are driving adoption in oil &amp; gas operations. Membrane-based VOC recovery systems now achieve <strong>95% capture rates</strong> from fugitive emissions and storage tanks.</p><p><strong>1. Hybrid Membrane-Absorption Systems:</strong><br>
Combining membrane pre-concentration with solvent absorption can cut carbon capture costs by 35%, making them viable for retrofit applications in coal plants.</p><p><strong>2. Next-Gen Membrane Materials:</strong><br>
Metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes demonstrate <strong>300% higher COâ/Nâ selectivity</strong> than conventional polymers in lab tests, potentially revolutionizing post-combustion capture.</p><p><strong>3. Biogas Refining:</strong><br>
With global biogas production expected to double by 2030, membranes offering 98% methane purity at 0.3 kWh/mÂ³ energy consumption are transforming waste-to-energy economics.</p><p>The market features a mix of industrial gas majors (<strong>Air Liquide, Air Products</strong>) and specialized membrane developers (<strong>MTR, Evonik</strong>). Recent developments include:</p><p>Findings are drawn from comprehensive analysis of over 300 membrane projects, 40 company profiles, and 5-year deployment trends across 18 key markets. Methodology combines primary interviews with operators and techno-economic modeling of membrane system performance.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
