<h1>Crack Sealing and Crack Filling Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>crack sealing and crack filling market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 826 million in 2023 to USD 1.09 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>4% CAGR during 2025-2030</strong>, according to new market research. This growth reflects rising infrastructure maintenance needs worldwide as governments and private entities prioritize cost-effective pavement preservation.</p><p>Crack sealing prevents water/debris intrusion in active cracks using specialized hot-applied sealants, while crack filling addresses non-working cracks with non-moving materials. Both techniques extend pavement lifespan by <strong>3-5 years on average</strong> compared to untreated surfaces while reducing long-term rehabilitation costs by up to <strong>75%</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Aging Infrastructure Demands Preventive Maintenance:</strong><br>
With <strong>40% of U.S. highways</strong> and <strong>30% of European roads</strong> exceeding design life, preventive treatments gain prominence. Crack sealing delivers <strong>6-8x cost savings</strong> versus reconstruction, driving adoption.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
