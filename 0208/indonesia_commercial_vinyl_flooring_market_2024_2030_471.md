New composites blend vinyl with <strong>bamboo fibers (30% content)</strong> for improved sustainability profiles while maintaining <strong>ISO 10582 durability ratings</strong>. These appeal to eco-conscious hotel chains and corporate clients.</p><p><strong>Advanced Installation Systems:</strong><br>
