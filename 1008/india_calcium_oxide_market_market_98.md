<h1>India Calcium Oxide Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The <strong>India Calcium Oxide (Quicklime) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$2.45 billion in 2024 to US$3.28 billion by 2030</strong>, demonstrating steady expansion at a <strong>5.0% CAGR</strong> during the forecast period. This industrial chemical remains indispensable across multiple sectors, particularly as India's infrastructure and manufacturing sectors undergo rapid modernization. The traditional applications in steel production and construction now share spotlight with emerging environmental applications, creating new revenue channels.</p><p><strong>1. Construction Boom &amp; Infrastructure Investments:</strong><br>
With India allocating <strong>â¹10 trillion (US$120 billion)</strong> for infrastructure in FY2024-25, calcium oxide demand continues its upward trajectory. The material's role in cement production (consuming <strong>65% of national output</strong>) remains pivotal. Major projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train and Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are accelerating consumption.</p><p><strong>2. Steel Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
As the world's <strong>second-largest steel producer</strong>, India's metallurgical sector consumes <strong>22% of domestic calcium oxide production</strong> for slag formation and impurity removal. With capacity targets of <strong>300 million tonnes by 2030</strong>, steelmakers are signing long-term supply contracts with lime producers.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
